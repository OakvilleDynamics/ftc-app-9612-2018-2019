## Detector module

This is where all of our OpenCV/DogeCV detectors are located for organization of class files
and code. As the season progresses, this should be filled with more detectors and testing methods
to get our filters just right.

### If you do not know what this is, it is highly suggested that you do not mess with anything else in this module
